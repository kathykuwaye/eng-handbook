## Hi, I’m Kathy.

### Motivation for this document

My intention for this document is to share my managerial philosophy, my values, expectations, and how I operate.

This is a living document and may change over time. Please let me know if there is anything out of alignment with my management style or my actions so that I can either correct myself or update this document. Your feedback will help me succeed as a manager.

### My role

As an engineering manager, I am a people manager, a project manager, and a solutions architect. Moreover, I am here to support you.

My two main goals:
- To help the business succeed.
- To help you succeed in your career.

### My availability

I will make time to talk if you need to talk. If my calendar is full with meetings, I will rearrange my schedule to make time for you.

#### Contacting me:

**Slack** to get my attention quickly or chat about something<br>
**Email** if you want an in-depth answer or have a complicated question.<br>
**Phone** or **SMS** when it’s something urgent.

If I send you a Slack message or email outside of your core working hours, I do not expect you to respond right away. Unless I state otherwise, it can wait until the next day. I likely just wanted to send the message/email while the thought was at the top of my mind, so I don’t forget.

### What do I value most?

I am a proponent of psychological safety. I will treat you with respect. I have your best interest in mind. It is ok to make mistakes; what is important is that we learn from them. I believe in a blameless culture i.e. it is not important *who* made the mistake but *what* we do to resolve the issue.

When you code, have empathy for our customers. Consider how and why they use our product. Produce a quality product. Treat coworkers with respect and empathy. Take ownership. If an issue is discovered in your code, fix the issue. Be proactive. Offer input where you can.

Taking ownership is multifaceted: ensuring there is alignment on understanding what is needed for the project, communicating the risks, asking all the pertinent questions (regarding design, stakeholders’ needs, etc.), implementation, eliciting feedback, and iterating through this process repeatedly until we are able to deliver.

### My expectations

- Everyone's ideas are valued equally.
- “Disagree and commit” – Everyone should feel comfortable sharing their opinion, but should be respectful when disagreeing with others opinions.
	- Once a decision is made, commit to executing it.
- State facts and leave emotions out.
- Be a life-long learner – please let me know if I can assist in this. I encourage you to continue to learn and grow.

### 1:1's

Weekly one-on-one meetings will be focused on you and will be guided by you. We can discuss your successes, your failures, your goals, your concerns. This is your opportunity to talk about what is on your mind.

### Idiosyncrasies

I am organized and particular. I like a tidy environment. I like to see clean code.

I am an avid note taker. I take notes in meetings and in 1:1’s to help me remember what was discussed. Please note I am in fact paying attention to you.

I appreciate when people do their homework and research the best solution, the best product or the best idea.

People who interrupt are a trigger for me. I don’t like when people try to evade answering a question. And, please don’t try to pull the wool over my eyes – I prefer honesty.

### What I do when I’m not working

I enjoy healthy decadent meals and staying physically active. I snowboard in the winter and mountain bike in the summer. I am trained in judo and jujitsu. I’m a former superbike racer but now I explore trails on my dirt bike. I love swing dancing (Balboa, to be specific) and enjoy travelling around the country with friends to different swing dance events.
